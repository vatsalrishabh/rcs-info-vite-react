Every company brand is keen to float the best website to bolster online presence and reputation and create a communicative, interactive interface or platform for its loyal clientele as well the prospective ones. New pages can be easily added, and graphic images can be uploaded in quick time. Hence, in recent times the demand of dynamic web development services has spurred.

The web pages, written in server-side scripting languages (PHP, ASP, ASP.Net,  JSP, Perl, ColdFusion) are generated in real-time since it is dependent on the user identity (hence ideal for customer targeting). The code on such page gets parsed on the web server and results in an HTML page which is then sent forth to the browser’s window. The server end languages deploy CGI (Common Gateway Interface) to create the web pages.
