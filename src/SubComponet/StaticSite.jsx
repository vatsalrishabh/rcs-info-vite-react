      <p>
      Old is gold – this holds true even for static website development services. In the nascent days, static website written in HTML (Hyper text Markup Language) held monopoly. In fact, every web designer would readily agree to the fact that mastering HTML is the basic step towards designing a career in web designing. 

Static website translates to static web pages which offer/present similar web content to every visitor. Content of the site are embedded in individual web pages written in HTML and are uploaded on the web server. Such pages are easy to code, easy to navigate, easy to load and are independent of user identity and access devices.  

Static websites made with HTML, CSS (Client-side Scripting) and JavaScript seem to be the first love of web designers and search engine optimizers because of the simplicity in creation of such pages.

Even dynamic web pages can be created using HTML coding but with limited functionality. In dynamic website case two-thirds of the site designing rests on HTML coding and rest one-third fetches content from the database.
